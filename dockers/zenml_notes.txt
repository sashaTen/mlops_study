Automated Deployment: ZenML streamlines model deployment by automatically deploying it when defined as a pipeline,
 eliminating the need for custom docker images.
 Artifacts: Inputs and outputs from each step in the pipeline.
Artifact Store: A versioned repository for storing artifacts, enhancing pipeline execution speed.
 ZenML provides a local store by default, stored on your local system.
 ZenML Server: Used for deploying ML models and making predictions.
