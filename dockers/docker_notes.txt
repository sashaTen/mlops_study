docker  image  is  created  from  the  docker  file 
it is  read  only 
it is  like  a  boilerplate 
there   images   for  node,js /ubuntu  or python 
---
1  you  build the image  with docker file 
then docker build -t my-python-app  in  bash 

then  you run   pr  stop   running   container.  
-----
Example Workflow:

Create a Python application with a requirements.txt file.
Write a Dockerfile to specify the base image, working directory, and commands.
Build the image using docker build.
Run the image as a container using docker run.
Access your application through the mapped port.

----------
Additional Tips:

Docker Compose: For managing multiple linked containers, use Docker Compose.
Docker Hub: Use Docker Hub to share and download images.
Docker Swarm: For creating clusters of Docker nodes, use Docker Swarm.

-------------

5. Interacting with Containers:
List running containers: Use docker ps.
Stop a container: Use docker stop <container-name>.
Remove a container: Use docker rm <container-name>.
Enter a running container: Use docker exec -it <container-name> bash.
6. Managing Images:
List images: Use docker images.
Remove images: Use docker rmi <image-id>.


-------
basically   you  cant  learn    docker   
perfectly   at  once    and it  takes   time to truly 
master  . so  practice and read   and  keep  learning 
and   improving
