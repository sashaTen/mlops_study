*AI in information systems research
*Enhanced Decision Support Systems: AI-powered decision support systems (DSS) are an area of growing interest.
*Continuous Learning Systems
*. The sub-themes under technology issues consist of data quality and
quantity, bias, model interpretability, scalability, ethical AI design,
explainable AI (XAI), AI governance and regulation,  architecture.
*AI is underpinned by technical
elements like machine learning, deep learning, NLP, speech recognition,
fuzzy logic and expert systems
*AI needs significant
improvement based on high-quality data in the form of 4 Vs (volume,
velocity, veracity and variety).
*AI should be premised on a new explainable and robust AI
theory

*. Some of the AI services
include customer support and chatbots, predictive analytics, recommendation systems, fraud detection, voice assistance, content generation, healthcare diagnostics and security and threat detection
*Data security emphasises the foundation of trust
*Researchers in this space focus on data classification
and minimization, anonymization and masking of data and developing
threat detection and response mechanisms
